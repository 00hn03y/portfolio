    <h1>Yeonhoo Cho</h1>
    <p>I'm Yeonhoo Cho, organizer at Red Canary Song and Master's student in City Planning at MIT's Department of Urban Studies and Planning. 
        <br>
        I'm passionate about exposing state-sanctioned violence that displaces migrant workers and silences their perspectives.
        It is my priority to highlight not only the threat of displacement, policing, and further impoverishment which they collectively face,
        but also the multitude of migrant-led collaborative economies in urban spaces which is an extension of the global fight for livable wage and workers’ rights.
        <br>
        Fights for livable wage and workers’ rights are borderless, structural issues that can be designed and redesigned. 
        This movement for liberation of all workers including those in feminized, racialized industries will continue in the next era. 
        I hope to be part of the community that builds for and listens to workers’ perspectives and transforms how decisions are made about the land and lives of the Global South.
