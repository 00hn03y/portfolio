    <h1>Yeonhoo Cho</h1>
    <p>I'm Yeonhoo Cho, organizer at Red Canary Song and Master's student in City Planning at MIT's Department of Urban Studies and Planning. 
        <br>
        I'm passionate about exposing state-sanctioned violence that displaces migrant workers and silences their perspectives.
        It is my priority to highlight not only the threat of displacement, policing, and further impoverishment which they collectively face,
        but also the multitude of migrant-led collaborative economies in urban spaces which is an extension of the global fight for livable wage and workersâ€™ rights.
